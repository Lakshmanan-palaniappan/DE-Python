Perfect, I’ll keep **your syllabus as the core** and add only the **normal README sections** (structure, how to run, purpose), without changing your topics or adding new ones.

You can paste this directly into `README.md`.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic. Each topic has its own folder containing example scripts and practice code.

```
.
├── packages/
├── scripts/
│   └── hooks/
└── src/
    ├── collections/
    ├── conditional_statements/
    ├── decorators/
    ├── exceptions/
    ├── files/
    ├── functions/
    ├── generators/
    ├── lambda/
    ├── looping_statements/
    ├── modules/
    ├── object_oriented_programming/
    └── py_assignment/
```

This structure will grow as more topics from the syllabus are added.

## How to Run the Code

Make sure Python is installed:

```
python --version
```

Run any file like this:

```
python path/to/file.py
```

Example:

```
python src/functions/functions.py
```
